Create a minimalistic, highly aesthetic auth modal for the **cineHub** app that keeps every piece of functionality from the existing auth modal but presents it with a modern glassmorphism look and clean UX. The modal should be a single reusable React component (Tailwind-first) that uses the project’s saved Tailwind theme and CSS variables, supports light and dark variants, and is fully responsive (mobile-first). Visual style: frosted glass panel with soft blur, subtle multi-stop gradient rim, semi-transparent backdrop, thin 2xl rounded corners, gentle shadow, micro-embossed border, roomy spacing and clear visual hierarchy (large title, smaller helper text). Include form states and features: sign in, sign up, passwordless OTP flow, “forgot password”, social logins (Google/Facebook/Apple), remember-me, password visibility toggle, password-strength meter, inline validation messages, server-error banner, loading / disabled states, and success state with subtle check animation. Accessibility & interactions: keyboard-first focus order, visible focus rings, ARIA labels/roles, screen-reader-friendly phrasing, high-contrast text fallback, and motion-reduced alternatives. Micro-interactions: smooth 160–300ms transitions for hover/focus, gentle entrance/exit animation (Framer Motion), subtle field shake for errors, and a progress skeleton for async steps. Developer notes: break into small subcomponents (ModalShell, AuthForm, SocialButtons, OTPInput, PasswordMeter, FormFooter), expose callbacks for all flows (onSignIn, onSignUp, onOtpSend, onForgot, onSocialLogin), use form library (react-hook-form + Zod) and centralized auth services (OAuth + backend endpoints), and preserve existing API contract so no backend work is required. Deliverables: responsive JSX/TSX file ready to paste into the repo, Tailwind classes only (use global theme variables), storybook stories for each state, and brief usage docs showing props and callbacks. Make it feel cinematic, minimal, and friendly—an unobtrusive frosted window that gets users into cineHub fast.
