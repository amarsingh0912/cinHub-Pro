Design an ultra-advanced, premium filter UI for a combined Movies & TV catalogue powered by TMDB, with every interaction mapped 1:1 to TMDB parameters and surfaced through polished, reusable components in my Tailwind design system (dark + light, glassmorphism, gradients, soft shadows, refined radii). Launch from a floating “Filters” button into a responsive side sheet (desktop) or haptic bottom sheet (mobile), focus-trapped and keyboard-accessible (⌘/Ctrl-K command palette). Use a natural-language bar (“thrillers since 2015 on Netflix rated >7 in India”) that parses into editable chips, and expose facets as follows—Type via SegmentedToggle → chooses /discover/movie or /discover/tv; Genres via ChipGroup (multi, include/exclude) → with_genres / without_genres; Keywords/Moods via Autocomplete (from /search/keyword) → with_keywords / without_keywords; People (Cast/Crew) via Autocomplete with avatars (from /search/person) → with_people; Companies/Networks via Autocomplete → with_companies / with_networks; Release/Air Dates via DualRangeSlider + quick chips (“This Year”, “2010s”) → Movies: primary_release_date.gte|lte, TV: first_air_date.gte|lte; Runtime via DualRangeSlider with inline histogram → with_runtime.gte|lte; Ratings & Votes via StarSlider + VoteFloor stepper → vote_average.gte|lte, vote_count.gte; Original Language via Select (with flag glyphs) → with_original_language; UI Locale/Region via Selects → language, region; Streaming Providers via LogoGrid (multi) + Monetization toggles → with_watch_providers, watch_region, with_watch_monetization_types=flatrate|free|ads|rent|buy; Certification via CountrySelect + ChipGroup (supports ranges) → certification_country, certification / certification.lte, plus Adult toggle → include_adult; Availability via ToggleGroup (In Theatres/On TV/Streaming) → Movies may leverage with_release_type (e.g., 2|3 for theatrical), TV via schedule-oriented filters when applicable; Sorting via Sticky SortSelect → sort_by=popularity.desc|vote_average.desc|vote_count.desc|primary_release_date.desc|first_air_date.desc|original_title.asc|name.asc|revenue.desc; and Include/Exclude Lists everywhere appropriate using TMDB’s with_* / without_* pairs. Show all selections as removable, draggable chips in a horizontal “Active Filters” bar with inline negation (tap to convert include↔exclude) and a persistent “Clear all”; reflect every change in shareable deep links by syncing URL query params exactly to the TMDB payload (including page, total_pages, total_results for live counts). Provide dynamic facet previews (counts/sparklines), instant updates with ~250 ms debounce, cancelable/batched requests, optimistic UI, infinite scrolling with virtualization and prefetch, plus quick-view hover cards (poster, rating, top credits, format badges like 4K/HDR/Atmos). Handle loading with shimmering skeletons, errors with friendly retries, empty states with smart relax-suggestions, and support presets as first-class (save, rename, star, reorder, share via deep link; compare presets in a pin-able drawer). Ensure world-class accessibility (ARIA, screen readers, keyboard-first, large touch targets, reduced-motion, high-contrast, RTL/locale-aware numbers and dates). The experience should feel like a creative discovery workspace—powerful for experts, effortless for newcomers—while keeping the TMDB mapping explicit through each UI component and its corresponding query parameters.
