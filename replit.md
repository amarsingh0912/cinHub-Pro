## Recent Changes

### UI Redesign - Movies & TV Shows Pages (October 16, 2025)
Redesigned the movies and TV shows pages with a modern, cleaner interface while maintaining all existing functionality.

**Visual Design Changes:**
- **Compact Hero Section**: Replaced large gradient header with streamlined design featuring icon badges and improved typography
- **Modern Stats Cards**: Added glass-morphism effect stats cards with subtle gradient hover animations showing results count and active filter count
- **Icon Badges**: Category icons now displayed in gradient-bordered cards next to page titles
- **Improved Spacing**: Reduced vertical spacing between header and content for better content density
- **Enhanced Layout**: Better responsive design with improved mobile and tablet layouts

**Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed nested button error in FilterChip component that was causing React hook violations
- Changed remove button from `motion.button` to accessible `motion.span` with proper ARIA roles
- Added keyboard support (Enter/Space) for filter chip removal for accessibility

**Technical Details:**
- All filtering, sorting, and infinite scroll functionality remains intact
- No changes to data fetching or state management logic
- Purely presentational layer updates
- Improved accessibility with proper keyboard navigation

### Codebase Cleanup (October 2025)
The following unused code and files were removed to improve maintainability and reduce bundle size:

**Frontend:**
- Removed 15 unused filter component files from `client/src/components/filters/` directory (kept only `PeopleAutocomplete.tsx` which is actively used)
- Removed 3 unused filter hooks: `use-filter-presets.ts`, `use-filter-result-count.ts`, `use-undo-reset.ts`

**Backend:**
- Removed unused `imageCache` service from `server/services/`
- Cleaned up corresponding imports in `server/routes.ts`
- Fixed security issue: Removed plaintext TMDB API key logging in development mode

**Other Files:**
- Removed development/testing files: `cookies.txt`, `trailer_modal.png`
- Cleaned up pasted design documents from `attached_assets/` directory

**Note:** All schema tables, active services (tmdbCache, cacheQueue, websocketService, cloudinaryService, otpService), and core functionality remain intact and fully operational.

### TMDB Discover API Refactoring (October 2025)
Refactored data fetching logic to use the unified TMDB Discover API for both Movies and TV Shows, replacing category-specific endpoints with dynamic, reusable API functions.

**Backend Changes:**
- Created `server/utils/tmdbDiscover.ts` with utility functions (`buildMovieDiscoverParams`, `buildTVDiscoverParams`) to generate discover API parameters for each category
- Refactored all movie endpoints (popular, upcoming, now_playing, top-rated) to use `/discover/movie` with category-specific parameters
- Refactored all TV endpoints (popular, airing_today, on-the-air, top-rated) to use `/discover/tv` with category-specific parameters
- Trending endpoints intentionally kept using original `/trending/` API for more accurate trending data

**Frontend Changes:**
- Created TypeScript types for discover parameters and categories in `client/src/types/tmdb.ts`
- Created React Query hooks (`useDiscoverMovies`, `useDiscoverTvShows`) for simplified data fetching
- All hooks properly typed with category-specific return types

**Key Implementation Details:**
- All discover endpoints include standard filters: `language=en-US`, `region=IN`, `include_adult=false`
- Movies include `with_release_type=2|3` for theatrical releases
- Upcoming uses `primary_release_date.gte` with current date
- Now playing uses 30-day date range with `primary_release_date.lte/gte`
- Top-rated uses `vote_count.gte` (500 for movies, 200 for TV) with `sort_by=vote_average.desc`
- Airing today uses 7-day forward date range with `air_date.gte/lte`

### Comprehensive TMDB Discover API Implementation (October 2025)
Enhanced the TMDB Discover API integration to support ALL available filters for both movies and TV shows, enabling complex filtering combinations.

**Backend Enhancements:**
- **Enhanced TypeScript Interfaces**: Added comprehensive `MovieDiscoverParams` and `TVDiscoverParams` interfaces in `server/utils/tmdbDiscover.ts` covering all TMDB filter options
- **Bearer Token Authentication**: Updated `fetchFromTMDB` to support Bearer token authentication (TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN) with fallback to API key
- **Comprehensive Discover Endpoints**: Enhanced `/api/movies/discover` and `/api/tv/discover` to accept all TMDB filter parameters:
  - **Movies**: genres, keywords, cast, crew, people, companies, release types, certifications (including .lte), date filters, runtime, ratings, language, region, streaming providers
  - **TV Shows**: genres, keywords, networks, companies, date filters, runtime, ratings, language, streaming providers, TV-specific filters (status, type, screened_theatrically, timezone)
- **Removed Duplicate Endpoints**: Cleaned up duplicate discover endpoints to ensure the comprehensive versions are used

**Frontend Enhancements:**
- **Enhanced Hooks**: Updated `useDiscoverMovies` and `useDiscoverTvShows` hooks with comprehensive filter support via `MovieDiscoverParams` and `TVDiscoverParams`
- **Custom Filter Hooks**: Added `useDiscoverMoviesCustom` and `useDiscoverTvShowsCustom` for full parameter control
- **Helper Functions**: Added `buildMovieFilters` and `buildTVFilters` for creating filter objects with sensible defaults
- **Example Page**: Created `/discover-examples` page demonstrating real-world filter combinations:
  * Upcoming Movies in India (region + date + release type filters)
  * Highly Rated Sci-Fi Movies (genre + rating + vote count filters)
  * Family-Friendly Animated Movies (genre OR logic + certification filters)
  * Currently Airing TV Shows (date range filters)
  * Top Rated Dramas (genre + rating + vote count filters)
  * Trending Netflix Originals (network + date filters)

**Filter Logic:**
- Supports OR logic with `|` (pipe) and AND logic with `,` (comma) as per TMDB API specification
- Example: `with_genres=16|10751` means Animation OR Family
- Example: `with_cast=500,190` means Leonardo DiCaprio AND Samuel L. Jackson

**Available Filters:**
- **Movies**: with_genres, without_genres, with_keywords, without_keywords, with_cast, with_crew, with_people, with_companies, with_release_type, certification, certification.gte, certification.lte, primary_release_date.gte/lte, release_date.gte/lte, vote_average.gte/lte, vote_count.gte/lte, with_runtime.gte/lte, with_original_language, region, watch_region, with_watch_providers, with_watch_monetization_types, include_adult, include_video
- **TV Shows**: with_genres, without_genres, with_keywords, without_keywords, with_networks, with_companies, with_status, with_type, first_air_date.gte/lte, air_date.gte/lte, vote_average.gte/lte, vote_count.gte/lte, with_runtime.gte/lte, with_original_language, watch_region, with_watch_providers, with_watch_monetization_types, include_adult, include_null_first_air_dates, screened_theatrically, timezone
