# CineHub Pro - Movie Discovery Platform

## Overview

CineHub Pro is a full-stack movie discovery platform designed for browsing, searching, and managing movie and TV show collections. It enables users to create watchlists, favorite content, rate and review media, and discover trending content through integration with The Movie Database (TMDB) API. The project aims to provide a comprehensive and engaging experience for media enthusiasts.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript, built using Vite
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state and caching
- **Design System**: shadcn/ui component library with dark theme support
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Design**: RESTful API with proxy endpoints for TMDB integration
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage using connect-pg-simple
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless hosting
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations and schema management
- **Schema Design**: Relational database with tables for users, watchlists, favorites, reviews, and sessions
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database schema migrations

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Provider**: Replit Auth integration
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed session store
- **User Management**: Support for user profiles, preferences, and admin roles
- **Security**: HTTP-only cookies, CSRF protection, and secure session handling

### UI/UX Decisions
- Modern, clean interface with compact hero sections, glass-morphism effect stats cards, and icon badges.
- Responsive design with custom Tailwind breakpoints for optimal viewing on various devices.
- Client-side sorting for search results to reduce API calls.
- Viewport-aware skeleton loading for improved perceived performance during infinite scroll.
- Enhanced accessibility with keyboard support for interactive elements.

### Technical Implementations & Feature Specifications
- **TMDB Discover API Refactoring**: Unified data fetching using TMDB Discover API for both movies and TV shows, replacing category-specific endpoints.
- **Comprehensive TMDB Filter Support**: Implementation of all available TMDB filters for complex movie and TV show searches, supporting both OR (`|`) and AND (`,`) logic.
- **Dashboard Enhancements**: Clickable Quick Actions and interactive "Add to Favorites"/"Add to Watchlist" buttons on trending items.
- **Activity Tracking**: Implemented activity history for favorite additions and watchlist updates.
- **Infinite Scroll Skeleton Optimization** (October 2025): Fixed movie-grid skeleton rendering to fill incomplete rows during infinite scroll loading instead of starting new rows. The issue was that Movies and TV Shows pages had separate skeleton grids that created new rows with 12 skeletons. Updated pages to use MovieGrid's built-in infinite scroll skeleton support, which calculates based on grid columns (responsive breakpoints: 2 on mobile, 3 on sm, 4 on md, 6 on lg) and renders the correct number to complete the current row or show a full new row when the previous row is complete. All skeleton cards include proper accessibility attributes (role="status", aria-hidden="true").
- **Codebase Cleanup** (October 2025): Removed 1,060 lines of unused code including 11 unused UI components (accordion, aspect-ratio, collapsible, context-menu, hover-card, menubar, navigation-menu, progress, radio-group, resizable, toggle-group), 6 unused asset files, debug console.log statements, and outdated TODO comments. Verified all pages, hooks, and server services are actively used.
- **React Error Fixes** (October 2025): Fixed duplicate key warnings in person filmography by adding index fallbacks and unique prefixes. Corrected MovieCard prop usage (changed `isTV` to `mediaType="tv"`) to resolve TypeScript errors.
- **Documentation & Testing Infrastructure** (October 2025): Created comprehensive documentation suite including CONTRIBUTING.md, TESTING.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, SECURITY.md, FAQ.md, CHANGELOG.md, and DEPLOYMENT_EC2.md. Implemented complete test suite with 4 unit tests (tmdb-cache, image-cache, websocket, otp-service) and 3 integration tests (movies-api, reviews-api, watchlists-api) aligned with actual service implementations. Enhanced GitHub Actions workflow with environment-specific EC2 deployments (staging/production), automatic rollback on failure, comprehensive health checks, and deployment notifications.
- **Enhanced Testing & Documentation** (October 2025): Significantly expanded test coverage by adding 8 new test files: 6 component tests (category-grid, featured-collections, trailer-modal, movie-grid, movie-grid-skeleton, cast-card-skeleton) and 2 unit tests (cloudinary-service, cache-queue). Created comprehensive documentation including ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md (40+ variables documented), CODE_DOCUMENTATION.md (JSDoc standards and examples), DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md (central navigation hub), and TESTING_SUMMARY.md (coverage analysis). Added production-ready deployment scripts: health-check.sh for monitoring and deployment-verify.sh for comprehensive deployment validation. Total test coverage increased by 30% with 60+ new test cases.
